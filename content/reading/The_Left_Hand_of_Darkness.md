Cool book. I love the language. It's a long book, for the amount of plot going on, and you have to be up for some world building and politics, but it's a beautifully written work. I wish I'd read the physical copy the whole way through rather than started this on a road trip in audio like I did, because I find the names and places easier to track in written form here.
