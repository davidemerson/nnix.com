It's hard to beat Ginsberg for modern poetry. Howl is my favorite single one, but there are a ton of gems in here, and the stuff he wrote just before he died is really poignant, "Things I'll Never Do" as an example.

I had a funny experience in a confusing, overcrowded Whole Foods in NYC a few days before I read "A Supermarket in California", and somehow it's the standout in this recent browse-through because of that.
