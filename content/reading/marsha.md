Niche history, maybe, but I had to read it. You've got to do something with your life, and it's clear that Marsha found something to do which both fulfilled her and inspired others.

There's some discussion about fact and truth in history, and wikipedia documents some interesting drama regarding fact and truth (and inspiration) among Marsha documentarians, and who doesn't love a good nest of uncertainty? "Pierre Menard, Author of Don Quixote" in a wig. I don't think this was the intent, but it was the effect, and I'm ok with that!

I listened to the audiobook, and the narrator (also author) does a good job but speaks with wild deliberation. I've never before had a legitimate use for the 2x speed on Audible.
