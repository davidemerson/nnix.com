Worth reading, good quote:

> "All motivation is a desire to escape discomfort. Traction moves you toward goals, distraction moves you away from goals, and triggers prompt actions which are distraction or traction. Consider each action and whether it is moving your toward or away from a goal as you consider whether it is something in which you want to engage."
