R. Buckminster Fuller wrote extensively on the need to recognize the interconnectedness of disciplines. Perhaps because of his belief in this rampant interconnectedness, many of the artifacts he left behind are obtuse, or at least significantly open to interpretation.

This book follows threads of translation in Fuller's artifacts, attempting to demonstrate both the relationships (between geometry, material systems, language, and intellectual property) and the directionality of Fuller's translational representations (whether he intended to illustrate a concept graphically or whether he intended to develop a concept through illustration).
