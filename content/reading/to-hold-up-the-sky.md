Short stories by the author of The Three Body Problem series. He's an excellent writer, and I appreciate being able to read his work in a more compact format. These stories extend the themes we saw in his previous work- the contrast between the vast and the tiny, and the interactions between sentient beings, whether of ignorance, war, or indifference.

He writes quiet, poignant plots that speak to these grand notions. Again, the short format is less of a commitment than a trilogy, and a great way to preview his work if you haven't read Liu yet.

I was less impressed with the language of these stories than with that of The Three Body Problem. I'm a language reader, I love the poetry of words. This might be translation, I wouldn't know because I can't read the originals, but the language of his short stories is flatter, less florid. Never poorly written, I don't mind the writing, but it isn't beautiful like a lot of The Three Body Problem series was.
