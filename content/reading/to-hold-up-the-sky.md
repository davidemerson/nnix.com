Short stories by the author of The Three Body Problem series. He's an excellent writer, and I appreciate being able to read his work in a more compact format. These stories extend the themes we saw in his previous work- the contrast between the vast and the tiny, and the interactions between sentient beings, whether of ignorance, war, or indifference.

He writes quiet, poignant plots that speak to these grand notions. Again, the short format is less of a commitment than a trilogy, and a great way to preview his work if you haven't read Liu yet.
