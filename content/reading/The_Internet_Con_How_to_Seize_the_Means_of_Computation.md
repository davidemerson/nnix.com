The first half of this book is more focused than the second half, but the author very clearly did his research, and offers some interesting policy solutions to a problem I believe will prove ruinous to the internet. I don’t even mind that he flaunts politics which are clearly far left of mine, he writes well and honestly- it’s a good perspective and a potential solution.
