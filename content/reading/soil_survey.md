I'll sync notes on this to emerson.farm entry in projects. It's of local interest.

# notes

* The farm is on sheet 4 in this book.
* On the ridge, you have "CpD" or Colyer-Trappist complex, at 12-20% slope.
* Nearer the road, you have "FfE2" (Faywood-Fairmount-Rock outcrop complex, 20-30% slope) and "FdD2" (Faywood silt loam, 12-20% slope)

## Colyer series
(p. 69 in Soil Survey)
> "The Colyer series consists of shallow, well drained, slowly permeable doils. These soils formed in material weathered from black, fissile shale. They are on narrow ridgetops and side slopes in the uplands, mainly in the northern part of the county. Slopes range from 12% to 50%. The soils are clayey-skeletal, mixed, mesic Lithic Dystrochrepts."

## Faywood series
(p. 72 in Soil Survey)
> "The faywood series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable or slowly permeable soils. These soils formed in material weathered from limestone and mudstone interbeddded with thin layers of calcareous shale. They are on narrow ridgetops and side slopes in the uplands. Slopes range from 12% to 30%. The soils are fine, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalfs."

We also have Fairmount associations with the Faywood series indicated on the map,

> "Fairmont soils have a mollic epipedon and have bedrock at a depth of less than 20 inches."
