This is a clearly written, easily understood book which contains practical advice and exercises for producing basic welds using SMAW (stick) methods. The illustrations and photographs require no color nor flash to be clear and supportive of the text, and the whole thing leaves me wondering what has been gained by decades since of improvements to graphic design and printing in educational texts.

I can't give it a 5/5 because it's not a desert island book, so to speak, but it gets a surprising 4/5. Educational texts are rarely this concise and useful.
