A very good, fast read. The author is strong with plot, and only an ok writer, so it's not a beautiful book by any means, but it's a good book, and I would recommend it for science fiction fans. I very much appreciate how rationally bounded this book is. Hard sci fi is much easier to tolerate at all levels of literary accomplishment, and this is good hard sci fi.
