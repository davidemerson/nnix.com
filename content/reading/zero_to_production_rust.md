I picked this up as part of my work on [cherubgyre](https://cherubgyre.com). It's a really good, practical textbook on using Rust for web applications, which is not a native use case. I like the opinionation of the author, it's helpful to someone new to a language.

As a language, for development on the web, I got tired of Rust. I was constantly fighting dependencies, optimizing build times, and convoluting my code to get around what's fundamentally not a particularly great webapp language. I would write an OS in Rust, I would write a game in Rust, but there are better languages (like golang) for a web available API.

Very good technical book here, though, if you just want to make this happen in Rust.
