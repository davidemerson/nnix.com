This is an excellent book, but it's primarily a reference for the series written around it. Read the rest of the series or it will only serve to jog your thoughts on architecture.

That said, this book is the one you want if you're in the midst of a project. It's a litany of things to think about which make design more humane, dwellings more pleasant, towns more cohesive.

Full text is available online now, though the physical form will always be more pleasant. [Here's the full text.](https://nnix.com/pdfs/pattern_language.pdf)
