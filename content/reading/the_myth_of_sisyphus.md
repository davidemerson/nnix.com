Living without appeal is the only honest and liberating stance. The absurd doesnâ€™t demand escape, but awareness and revolt. Suicide is escape.

I agree with Camus. One does not need to have suicidal tendencies (I do not) to understand that this can also be an affirmation of life. What is there but engagement with the absurd?
