The first half of this book almost made it a DNF for me, and the second half (Time Passes and beyond) pulled it right out of a nosedive and into brilliance. A very strong work, not as fragmentary as Ulysses, and also not as inspired, but beautiful nonetheless.

I read this book on a trip to Skye, but maybe the biggest mistake Woolf made was writing it about an island she didn't visit until ten years after publication - there is almost nothing relevant (or accurate) to Skye in here, a funny bit of trivia.

Recommended for anyone who loves modernist literature, just hang in there through the Victorian mores long enough to realize that the book gets good when they go away in the second half!
