I'm sure everyone who read this book in 2004 thought these issues would be solved by 2025 because they were apparently untenable back then. Well, yeah, here we are, 21 years after publication and no real solution. In fact, it's probably worse now than it was, certainly there are more crossings than there were in 2004.

Well written, compassionate book on the fraught subject of border crossings and border enforcement in the US. Not a long read, and worthwhile.
