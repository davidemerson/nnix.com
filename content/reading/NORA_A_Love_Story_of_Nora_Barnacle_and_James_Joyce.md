The relationship between Nora and James should have made for a great book. Their family life has more than enough drama, and the use of letters and quotes gives it an anchoring in the real world. I wanted to like this book more. I'm glad it was written, it's a cool concept, but it wears thin where the reconstruction (of Nora's thoughts) drags on. I'd rather it have been an exchange of letters, I think, the inner thoughts seem too speculative and also too vague. Neat idea, though.
