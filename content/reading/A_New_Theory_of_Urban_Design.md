This one is the lightweight of the series. Probably most interesting to an urban planner, less interesting to the individual contributor. Also contains less valuable management insight, which, strangely, the rest of the series features. Unlike The Linz Cafe, though that book is far shorter, this doesn't manage to translate it's lessons to something more universal.&nbsp;
