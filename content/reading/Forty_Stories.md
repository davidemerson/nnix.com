Clean stories, good stories, but they don't age as well as short stories written just a few years later. Chekhov is an excellent writer, he's just not modern enough for a modern audience to glean poignancy from his work. This might be a translation thing, too, but I think it's probably a broader cultural shift in storytelling, and what's considered interesting.

His work is neither old enough to feel like you're seeing through time (Chaucer) nor new enough to be relatable to a modern audience (Joyce).
