Beck's references to Dante are tenuous at worst and unspecial at best. It doesn't ruin the book, but it's a bit of an unnecessary parallel, fluffy.

Her core notion of dissonance causing distress is similar to other books I've read and incorporated in a positive sense, like Nir Eyal's "Indistractable", I don't find that objectionable.

> "All motivation is a desire to escape discomfort. Traction moves you toward goals, distraction moves you away from goals, and triggers prompt actions which are distraction or traction. Consider each action and whether it is moving your toward or away from a goal as you consider whether it is something in which you want to engage." (Eyal, Indistractable)

Also no different than any of the many notions of cognitive dissonance. One should indeed look for coherency between what you are, what you believe, and what you are doing. That will reduce dissonance for you, but reduction of dissonance is not a singular pursuit, nor absolute. The notion of integrity (reduction of dissonance) hazards becoming a cultural conceit in itself, no different than status or wealth. Integrity might be a helpful concept but I don't think it's fully achievable, or even desirable.

"Don't ever mention the rules" is an excellent way to describe a lot of cultural pretense, I like that. Like secrecy, politeness is technically unnecessary but practically helpful at times. I don't believe there should never be cultural pretense, but I do believe it's helpful to recognize what pretense exists, and then that pretense is not of service.
