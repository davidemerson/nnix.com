Beck's references to Dante are tenuous at worst and unspecial at best. It doesn't ruin the book, but it's a bit of an unnecessary parallel, fluffy.

Her core notion of dissonance causing distress is similar to other books I've read and incorporated in a positive sense (I'll add reference here when I dig it up), I don't find that objectionable.

This notion of integrity hazards becoming a cultural conceit in itself, no different than status or wealth. Integrity might be a helpful concept but I don't think it's fully achievable, or even desirable.
