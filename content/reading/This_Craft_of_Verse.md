This is an excellent lecture by Borges. Insightful and fun to read, great for fans of literary criticism and writing and reading.

I was inspired by this lecture's citation of [_Lunario sentimental_](https://nnix.com/images/lunariosentimental/lunario_sentimental_original.pdf), and I [published](https://nnix.com/projects/lunario-sentimental/) an English translation of the work when I found none available.
