Do I have trouble with novels in the first person? Perhaps!

The story is fun though. In an traditional epic sense, we meet Circe as a rather undeveloped character, a powerful witch type in her palace on a remote island.

Miller provides the missing back-story, and makes her a much more complicated, interesting individual.

I also did not know or remember that her son (with Odysseus) kills Odysseus, even in original canon. That's a typically dramatic and curious twist!
