A lot has changed since this book was published in 2021.

Also, it's strange reading a book with so many sources you know personally, or have met.

In the end, though, I can't say I learned much, nor can I say her breathless examination of a threat would be of much educational value to others.

Perhaps, like Unit X, this kind of journalism just doesn't age well, or perhaps I'm not a good audience for this sort of book (it's hard to make a hacker movie too).

Nothing in here was untrue, though!
