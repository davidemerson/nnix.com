This book needs to be 2/3rds shorter than it is. It would be an excellent (long) short story, the premise is cool. I'd get on board for a shorter form exploration of man's place in nature, but seven hours is not justified.

Some of my reaction here may be that it's all dialogue, which is disproportionately fatiguing to me.

The book is marketed as a "spiritual" book, and I don't get that. It's science fiction, a dialogue between a gorilla and a man about why man is distinct from other animals, and why, or whether, that distinction dooms man, as a species.
