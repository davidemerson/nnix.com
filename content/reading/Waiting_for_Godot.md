This play and The Fantasticks are my favorites, and they share a minimalism that speaks to anyone fatigued by excessive production values getting in the way of good writing and acting. Sure, this is a crucible for whomever pulls the straw of Lucky, and not much easier for the other characters, but it's refreshing to see the emphasis be on the talent of a few rather than flash and technical work of many.
