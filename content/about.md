I'm a tech person by trade, but this isn't a place for that business, necessarily. This is my web dumping ground. I upload something when it strikes my fancy. Herein are numerous gaps and omissions.

Most of this site is an alternative to allowing others to format and own my content. It's easier for me to maintain than GoodReads, prettier than a GitHub readme, and subject to my whims, not those of a third party service.

None of this is for money, it's for reference, tinkering, and sharing. <a href="https://tilde.town/~dozens/sofa/">SOFA Club</a>-certified kind of stuff.
