Most of this site is an alternative to allowing others to format and own my content. It's easier for me to maintain than GoodReads, prettier than a GitHub readme, and subject to my whims, not those of a third party service.

None of this is for money, it's for reference, tinkering, and sharing.<a href="https://tilde.town/~dozens/sofa/">SOFA Club</a>-certified kind of stuff.
