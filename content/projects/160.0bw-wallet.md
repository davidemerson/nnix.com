I've made a few of these now, but I never formalized the dimensions. It'll be easier to make with a die, so here's what I'll use as a reference inner dimension for that die:

{{ img(id="/images/160.0bw/wallet_template.png", alt="a dimensioned drawing of a wallet made of leather") }}

If you want a PDF drawing, grab it [here](https://nnix.com/images/160.0bw/wallet.pdf).

An STL file of the same object is [here](https://nnix.com/images/160.0bw/wallet.STL).

Man, I don't know what else to say. This is a short one.

* Cut the leather to the dimensions indicated.
* Thin the leather at the midpoint between the 2mm triangles so it folds more easily.
* Fold in half at the midpoint.
* Sew together at each edge.
* Finish the ends of the leather.
* Use until it falls apart. This will be a very long time unless you keep washing it on heavy-duty cycle in your pants.

This holds five to six credit-card-sized objects. I usually carry two credit cards, one ID, and two RFID badges in it. Nobody needs cash any more.
