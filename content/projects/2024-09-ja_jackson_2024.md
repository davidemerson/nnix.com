# overview

{{ img(id="/images/jajackson/life.jpeg", alt="I wasn't in a great mood when I built this, but I had a cool pencil and calipers so") }}

This is the second iteration of a bicycle I made in 2023, improving upon a number of issues logged over the course of the last year, and allowing the frame from the previous project to be reused in another (future) bicycle build.

It is a titanium-framed road/touring cycle with an internally geared rear hub of eight speeds. It has a number of features atypical of road/touring cycles, such as track dropouts, both disc and rim brake mount points, threads for all manner of fenders, racks, and accessories, clearance for wider wheels, clearance for fenders, a rear quick-release hub space of 135mm, and a tapered headset tube. If you look "off the rack" for this combination of things, you simply won't find such a bike. I don't know why that could be, but I do know how to make one.

The name is one I give whichever bike I'm riding primarily. It comes from a Joycean description of a Trinity College bike race:

> "Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint. J. A. Jackson, W. E. Wylie, A. Munro and H. T. Gahan, their stretched necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library."

# specifications
I apologize in advance, some units are metric and some English, but this is not a preference: the world of bicycles is a confusion of units.

## assembly torque values
It's handy to have a single table of the torque values you should be using for assembly of the bike, since they need to be looked up in multiple places otherwise. Here are the ones important for this version of the bike:
<div>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Part</th>
    <th>Torque</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bottom Bracket<br></td>
    <td>44 Nm</td>

    <td>Brake Cable Fixing Screw</td>
    <td>7 Nm</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Brake Caliper Direct Mounting Screw</td>
    <td>7 Nm</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Brake Caliper Recessed Nut (Rear)</td>
    <td>10 Nm</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Brake Shoe Attachment Screw</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Chainring Screws</td>

## gearing
The Alfine 8 hub is attached to a 21t rear sprocket, and the chainring on the crank is 43t. This results in the following eight gears, in gear-inches:
<div>
 <table>
  <tr>
    <th>Gear Inches</th>
    <th>Incremental Change</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>29.1</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>35.6</td>
    <td>18.26%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>41.4</td>
    <td>14.01%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>47</td>
    <td>11.91%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>55.3</td>
    <td>15.01%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>67.6</td>
    <td>18.20%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>78.5</td>
    <td>13.89%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>89.4</td>
    <td>12.19%</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

When I'm pedaling at 80 RPM, which is typical for me, these gears translate to the following speeds in MPH:
<div>
 <table>
  <tr>
    <th>Gear</th>
    <th>MPH @ 80 RPM</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>7.8</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>9.5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>11.1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>12.6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>14.8</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>18.1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>21</td>

  <tr>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>23.9</td>

### alfine 8 documentation
The hub for this build has [good documentation I've copied here](/images/jajackson/alfine-manual.pdf). There's a particularly important bit about the alignment of the various dots on the pulley side of things, which, without knowing, you'll waste a lot of time divining. The critical illustrations are reproduced here:

## frame material
The frame is made of a titanium alloy called 3Al-2.5V. This alloy is 95% titanium, 3% aluminum, and 2% vanadium. As a bike frame material, titanium works well for me.
- It is not as light as carbon, but it has a much longer riding lifespan, and requires less specialized maintenance routines, such as very careful torque application in fasteners, or friction pastes.
- It is heavier than aluminum, but has a longer riding lifespan, and slightly better corrosion resistance.
- It is lighter than steel, but about as strong, and features far greater corrosion resistance.

# grievances (issues)
I keep notes on what to change for next time here, as I did with the previous iterations of this bike. No one of these would precipitate a rebuild, but if I were to rebuild for some other reason, I will incorporate fixes to them.

- Cable routing with zip ties is inelegant. It was necessary here because I forgot to design in housing mounting clips on both chain stay bottoms (only one of them has mountings). The zip ties work well, to be clear, they're just not as elegant as integrated mountings.
- I don't have a good way to plug the unused cable routing ports on the bike. I might specify that they be threaded at the ends or something so I can use a bolt to cover them in the future. I like having the number of routings I have, since I may use them in the future, but I would prefer an elegant way to seal them when not in use.
- I am seriously tempted to have some drilled portions of the rear seatstays for LED integration. I would love to make the next iteration of this bicycle a crazy flashing circus. I'll have to think through the effect on rigidity, but it seems like a few 3mm holes wouldn't be all that bad, and you can get some really bright SMDs in that space nowadays, wired internally to a battery stashed somewhere in a tube. Just an idea.
