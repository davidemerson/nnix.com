# overview
I [chainsaw-milled](https://nnix.com/projects/logmilling) some slabs from a tree which died in my yard, of lightning strike. The piece at the top of the log was nothing special for nice furniture, but still large enough to make a simple bench from.

# process
* Cut the log to rough dimensions with a chainsaw
* Plane the log flat. This took a lot of planing because there was such a prominent cup to the end piece.
* Seal with deck polyurethane. I hope this can take the weather
* Cut steel scrap for a base, weld
* Assemble
