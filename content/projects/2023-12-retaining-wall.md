# overview
Sometimes you have a hill, and you need to get up that hill. A staircase on the hill is made more interesting by a couple retaining walls which conceal its profile, unfolding as you apprach.

This design took a long time, but only because of permit requirements. In the end, I cancelled the plan because my county wanted more in fees than it was going to cost to construct the wall itself, inclusive of labor. Next time you find yourself wondering why housing is so expensive, don't forget to consider how completely gridlocked our permitting process is nearly everywhere.
