# concept
This mold is intended to produce replicas of a tile I use to repair parts of my house. I designed it to be 3D printable, since these tiles are more likely to be produced in quantity. The previous block projects, which are lower volume production, were made of aluminum castings due to their size.

# drawings
The mold concept is illustrated here:
