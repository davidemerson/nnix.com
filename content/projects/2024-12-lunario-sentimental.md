# overview
One of my favorite books, a lecture by Jorge Luis Borges on writing, cites a Leopoldo Lugones work for which I can find no English translation. Let's get one out in the world.

# original
The original work was published in 1909, and has since entered the public domain. You can download it [here](https://nnix.com/images/lunariosentimental/lunario_sentimental_original.pdf).

# translation
Spanish to English translation was done by Oskarina Perez. I chose her for her familiarity with the genre and the author.

# typesetting
I typeset the work in XeLaTeX, to provide modern font support. EB Garamond was chosen for its wide character support and handsome form.
