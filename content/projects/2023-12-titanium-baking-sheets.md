# the whole idea, briefly
Let's say you have a bunch of 2mm thick titanium sheet. It happens. Perhaps you were making cold wallets for your crypto, or writing a poem by beating it into the sheet with a mallet and some punches. Who knows what you were doing, but you have these sheets.

And a metal brake. [This one from Harbor Freight](https://www.harborfreight.com/30-inch-bending-brake-67240.html) is cheap and works. If you want it to work better, weld a length of C-channel steel on the part that moves, to make it more rigid. You'll know what I mean when you use this thing - it warps a little under the strain of bending 2mm titanium, which is technically well out of its spec.

Put a bend in them, it stiffens the sheet, makes it easier to grip with a hot pad, and looks sick. If you want to be fancy, but the bend on the corner, but I like it on the edge, and one inch in depth.

It's hard to bend 2mm titanium with a metal brake. Clamp this down to the brake surface really well, with good clamps. I bent numerous cheap clamps trying this out, but settled on a 1500lb-rated steel model, and that did the trick (four of them).

Then go make croissant. Or sell these on Etsy so other people can, I haven't patented this or anything yet, but I'm sure the hipsters would love it. The bakers in your family will be placing orders too, so be ready.

I've made them in all sizes now, too, but keep in mind that the longer the bent edge, the harder this is to do with a modest brake. Mine can't handle more than about 400mm of length in 2mm sheet. Larger brakes are really expensive.
