# overview

I [chainsaw-milled](https://nnix.com/projects/logmilling) some slabs from a tree which died in my yard, of lightning strike. Now I'm making a table of some kind from them. Purpose of table? TBD. Design? TBD. This is a placeholder doc as things progress.

# process
* Slabs were cut and stacked on aluminum staves to allow air space. They were dried outdoors under cover for two years. I'm in the mid-Atlantic, so ambient humidity is very high on average
* Slabs were transported 07-2025 to Shenandoah Planing Mill, which will dry them in a vacuum kiln
* After drying, slabs will be planed flat on all sides and to common maximum thickness. These dimensions of the final slabs will be used to design the table size
* Slabs will be cut to size and joined into a table surface
* A slot will be CNC machined in the bottom of the slabs to accept a c-channel to provide stability
* Tabletop will be sanded and finished as appropriate
* Tabletop will be mounted to an Eames Modular Table Base
