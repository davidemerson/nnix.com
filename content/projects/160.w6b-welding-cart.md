# overview
I took up welding a couple years ago, and I upgraded my equipment recently, now that I almost know what I'm doing. The new unit is larger, it needs a cart when I move it around, and I have very little space in which to store said cart.

The welding carts which exist on the market are constrained by shipping (designs appropriate for flat-pack) and by cost (thin sheet metal, undersized dimensions).

This seems like an obvious, accessible project for someone looking to build their skills and house their tools at the same time.

# details
Overall height of the cart will be about 42" from floor to work surface on top. Overall length will be 36", and width 24".

The cart will have space to hold at least one 40 cubic foot gas cylinder, for when I need argon shielding gas.

There is a space reserved for a plasma cutter next to the multiprocess welding machine.

There are four 120VAC 20A receptacles for small appliances like grinders and sanders.

The top plate has fixture clamp holes at regular intervals for fixing workpieces in places when welding. It's also at a very convenient height for getting close to something while standing.

I'm working in inches on this project because steel locally is sold in inches, and it's hard to convert accurately when ordering.

Build commenced 1 January 2025. I didn't get to painting it yet, and I'm changing out the top from the design, but I'm not sure to what yet. Otherwise, it's in production as a cart. I would recommend this design, it makes a very comfortable place to work on a project while remaining mobile.
